# Micro-IT-Internship

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python GUI projects developed during a micro internship using **Tkinter** in **Pydroid 3 (Android)**:

- **Calculator App**
- **To-Do List Application**

Both apps are designed with simple, user-friendly interfaces and built for mobile-friendly development environments like Pydroid 3.
